#1.1 Think About Time Reflection

I for one am really bad at time management, but after looking at all of these different resources I now have a clear plan to tackle this issue. Before I would tell myself "I need to be organize and meet deadlines" but without any ideas of actually doing so I would just continued on scrambling last minute.

The article that talked about meditation really interested me. I was always intrigue of the benefits meditations can offer. But the most valuable lessoned from that article was actually about how to start a habit. This simple advice blew my mind, it basically states that if you want to start a habit you can start with very small amounts of it until it grows into a big part of your life. I have never looked at it that way.

I always approached habits as immersive all ins. Like if I don't commit 100% everyday, I will let myself down.

Now knowing this piece of advice, I feel that I can be way more forgiving to myself and to take in what I can until the habit grows on me. This will really help me with my time. Instead of thinking about doing this habit for hours a day.

I can start with maybe 10 minutes a day and then work my way forward. This will help with habits dropping and any overwhelming feeling that I could possibly get from trying to keep up with this on going process. This is very important because I have noticed that when I get overwhelmed I am more likely to put off things on my schedule. 

Being now aware of my time spent on a certain task mixed well with this idea of time-boxing. Time-boxing can explain why my new action plan works very well. For example I want to start a habit of swimming everyday. I shouldn't go through the day until swimming happens when it most convenient and then check it off my list at the end of the day, although that methods provides flexibility this is what make me fail overall in making swimming a habit. I just wait until it's too late to swim and then wouldn't be able to do it at all.

So the best way is to use time-boxing and set a time frame for swimming and when the time is up I must stop and reflect on how much swimming did I actually do and if I am satisfied with the results. 



#1.2 The Command Line Reflection

A shell is like an interpreter that handles inputs and outputs. I have trouble in the past remembering commands but now that I am going over it again in depth I feel a lot more comfortable navigating throughout the command line. For one I am making more use of pwd. I mainly use this to copy and paste my current directory for reference but now I can see myself using it a lot when Im lost. I use to just change out of my directory to see where i am currently but now pwd will replace that. 

The most I use is ls, cd, and probably touch. ls and cd is necessary for navigation and touch is create files. pwd is print working directory, ls is to list current directory, mv is to move files, cd is to change directory, ../ is to go one layer above the current directory, touch is to create a file, mkdir is to make a directory, less is to view the content of text files, rmdir is to remove directory, rm is to remove a file, and finally help will show a list of useful commands.

#1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection


Github is very overwhelming at first but is such a powerful tool. It's basically a time machine that two or more people can use to collaborate their code without having much confusion and hassle to work at different locations.  
To create and new repository on github you would go on github.com and after logging in clicking the + icon then selecting New Repository.  Then you give it a title and description, and finally making a choice of it being a pubic or private. Their are two things you could do to a repository: clone and fork. When you clone a repository you are creating a complete copy of the repository onto your local computer.  
Any changes on the copy will not affect the original and you have free reign to mess with it as much as you want. When you fork a repository you are also making a copy but the copy is on github. Again the copy is identical but you have the option now to send pull requests. You are again have free reign to mess with the repository without affecting the original but now you can send a pull request to ask the original copy if it would like to be updated with your changes.  
It is best to fork when you want to collaborate on a project with more than 2 people. The way this works is that the group will have access to the origin repository of the current project. They will all each have their own forked (copy) repository of the project and then can proceed to make changes without affecting the original.  
When changes wants to be submitted they will have to send a pull request to the origin repository which will allow others within the group to review the changes made before actually committing the changes. Commit is basically to save as a checkpoint. The checkpoint will have every file within the project's current state and saves it for future reference.
