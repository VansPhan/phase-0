- Describe what open source means.   
Open source is sharing source code and allowing others in the community to build upon that code. 
- What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
Open source is amazing, it creates a sense of community and amazing things have came out of open source. I haven't ever made code that is worth being protective about so I my ideas on this matter is subject to change. But I do know for a fact amazing ideas and improvements were made solely due to applications being open source. So as of now I am all for it.

Licenses protects both the developer and the user. Not only does it protect freedom but it puts things into perspective that this is intellectual property. 
- What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
The ideas of git branches really solidified during this challenge. The moment I figured that this gh-page actually was working off of the "master" branch rather than the "gh-pages" branch I felt like a weight was lifted off of my shoulders.
