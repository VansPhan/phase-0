<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
	Seeing things come to life was awesome. I like to see code being translated into something that you could see write away, so it really was my favorable learning environment.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
	There were tons of resources and I guess that's because html has been around a long time and widely used. It was very easy to research.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
	I did my best indent my nesting of tags, they really help seperate the tags visually and are a lot easier on my eyes especially moments of debugging. 
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
	The great thing is that it's pretty simple to implement html, the bad part about it is that it's limited. You can only make things appear as it is so there is no sense dynamics with just html. 
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
	Know that it exist and google.
