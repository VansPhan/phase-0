**What does puts do?**  
Puts returns nil and prints the output to the console with a new line  


**What is an integer? What is a float?**  
An integer is a number without any decimals and floats are numbers with decimals.   


**What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?**  
If you are dividing integers then there will be no remainders in the answers. Only float division will give you a more accurate answer with decimals.  


**hour_in_a_year**  
```
def hours_in_year
	# 1 year is equal to 365 days
	# 1 day is equal to 24 hours
	# Therefore we multiply 365 with 24 to get the total
	# amount of hours in a year.
	365 * 24
end

puts "There are #{hours_in_year} hours in a year!"

```

**minutes_in_a_decade**
```
#1 decade is 10 years
#1 year is 365 days
#1 day is 24 hours
#1 hour is 60 minutes
# Therefore we multiply 10, 365, 24, and 60 together to get the total
# amount of minutes in a decade.

def minutes_in_a_decade
	10 * 365 * 24 * 60
end

puts "There are #{minutes_in_a_decade} minutes in a decade!"

**How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?**  
Ruby handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers by going left to right and following the order of operations.  
**What is the difference between integers and floats?**  
An integer is a number without any decimals and floats are numbers with decimals.  
**What is the difference between integer and float division?**  
Integer division would round the answer as for float division ruby would leave the answer as a decimal.  
**What are strings? Why and when would you use them?**  
Strings are characters that can be used in many ways. One way to use them is to output texts to users to communicate.  
**What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?**  
Local variables are placeholders that can hold various types of objects. Being a local variable means that it can only be used within the scope and does not exist outside the scope.  
**How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?**  
This challenge was very helpful by how it strings everything together into one challenge and each part was not overwhelming. This was really good review for me.
