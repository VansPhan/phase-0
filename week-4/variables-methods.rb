# How do you define a local variable?
# Have a valid variable name and make it equal to an object.

# How do you define a method?
# You define a method by wrapping your code with "def" followed by a method name of your choice
# and then finally putting "end" at where your code ends.

# What is the difference between a local variable and a method?
# A local variable can only be used in its scope and is on a reference of an object. A
# method can be used globally and consist of many lines of code that accomplish a
# specific task.

# How do you run a ruby program from the command line?
# You type "ruby" followed by the file name of your ruby file.

# How do you run an RSpec file from the command line?
# You type "rspec" followed by the file name of your test.

# What was confusing about this material? What made sense?
# I understood the logic behind implementing the material but had trouble with
# syntax and code format. I understand that there is no perfect way to write code, 
# but I can improve my naming with variables and methods to better express my
# code clearly.
